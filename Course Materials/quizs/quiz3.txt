Let h1(t) and h0(t) denote the hazard function for patients on the treatment and control group, respectively. We have  h1(t)/h0(t)=2.

  S_1(t) < S_0(t) 
  S_1(t) > S_0(t)

Let h_1(t) and h_0(t) denote the hazard function for patients on the treatment and control group, respectively. We have  h_1(t)/h_0(t)=2. Let H_1(t) and H_0(t) denote the cumulative hazard function for the treatment and control group. Which statement is correct?

We fit two Cox models, where model 1 regresses on treatment (1 vs 0) while model 2 regresses on treatment (1 vs 0), age (continuous), sex (M vs F), and race (White, Black, and Other). If we want to test whether model 2 is better than model 1, which test can be used based on the information provided in SAS output?

  Likelihood ratio test 
  Wald test
