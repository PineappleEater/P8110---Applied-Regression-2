In a multinomial logistic regression, suppose that $Y$ has 4 categories, and the investigator is interested in testing whether age (continuous, measured in years)  is associated with $Y$. What is the degrees of freedom associated with the test?

In a proportional odds regression, suppose that $Y$ has 4 categories, and the investigator is interested in testing whether age (age groups, 4 categories) is associated with Y. If the investigator wants to test whether proportional odds assumption is reasonable, what is the degrees of freedom associated with the test?

A study was conducted to identify factors that explain difference in the number of hospital admission between different hospitals. The number of hospital admission was collected based on different time intervals in different hospitals, ranging from 3 months to 12 months. If fitting a Poisson regression model, the offset will be defined as

  number of months that hospital admission data were collected in a hospital 
  natural log of number of months that hospital admission data were collected in a hospital
